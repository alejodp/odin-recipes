    <p>What we have here is equal parts tuna and rice by weight, which for me, gives this the perfect balance between protein and starch. While this may remind some people of a fried rice dish, this is significantly lighter, and actually very low on fat content, but that doesn't mean it's not satisfying, and like most rice dishes, it's very comforting.</p>
